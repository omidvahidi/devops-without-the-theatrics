# Terraform examples (minimal)

These files illustrate the boundary discussed in the book:

- Terraform defines what exists (infrastructure shape).
- Configuration management defines how hosts converge.
- Pipelines decide when change is allowed.

This is not a production module and does not include provider credentials, remote state configuration, or environment separation. Those concerns are real, but intentionally out of scope for this companion repository.
